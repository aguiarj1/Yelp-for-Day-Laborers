# Yelp for Day Laborers app
A website and app for day laborers and their employers to connect.

## Description:
Both workers and contractors in the informal ‘Day labor’ market have been relying on human connections to find jobs or labors without sufficient information for both sides. We recognize that with an IT solution, we can reduce the information gaps and improve economic opportunities in this informal market. We are expecting our solution can increase matching efficiency between workers and contractors. 

## Why this project exists:
Several students from Seattle University wanted to do a tech project that made a positive impact in the community. 

## Timeline:
* We plan to have a deployed solution by August 2018.
